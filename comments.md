Firstly my time contribution to this assignment was sub-par and I will be dedicating much more time in creating better things in the future.

For my choice of data I mostly looked at the GitHub of "Awesome Public Datasets" and about 1/3 of the links don't have csv files to download and the ones that I could download the files were so big I could not open them.
I've used Twitch before and have seen the metrics before, so the dataset also felt familiar to me.

The first graph I decided to plot time streaming against average viewer count. My hypothesis was that the more time you had your stream up the higher your view count would be on average.
This graph had a downward trend for the average streamer, and I assume the outliers of the graph could be either eSports channels or very popular streamers that have consistent viewers so their average view count would be closer to their peak view count.
I concluded from the graph that my hypothesis was incorrect and showed the opposite instead.

My second graph (if it were completed) I wanted to compare the total watch time of a channel to it's followers. My hypothesis of this is that it would look similar to the first graph with a downward trend; the streaners with a higher viewer count would also carry a proportionally equal followership.
